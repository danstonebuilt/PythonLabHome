The {% for %} tag allows you to loop over each item in a sequence. As in Python’s for statement, the
syntax is for X in Y, where Y is the sequence to loop over and X is the name of the variable to use for a
particular cycle of the loop. Each time through the loop, the template system will render everything between
{% for %} and {% endfor %}.

For example, you could use the following to display a list of athletes given a variable athlete_list:

<ul>
{% for athlete in athlete_list %}
	<li>{{ athlete.name }}</li>
{% endfor %}
</ul>

Add reversed to the tag to loop over the list in reverse:
{% for athlete in athlete_list reversed %}
...
{% endfor %}

It’s possible to nest {% for %} tags:
{% for country in countries %}
	<h1>{{ country.name }}</h1>
	<ul>
		{% for city in country.city_list %}
			<li>{{ city }}</li>
		{% endfor %}
	</ul>
{% endfor %}
