{% if today_is_weekend %}
	<p>Welcome to the weekend!</p>
{% endif %}

An {% else %} tag is optional:

{% if today_is_weekend %}
	p>Welcome to the weekend!</p>
{% else %}
	<p>Get back to work.</p>
{% endif %}

Python “Truthiness”
In Python, the empty list ([]), tuple (()), dictionary ({}), string (''), zero (0), and the special object None
are False in a Boolean context. Everything else is True.

The {% if %} tag accepts and, or, or not for testing multiple variables, or to negate a given variable. For
example:

{% if athlete_list and coach_list %}
	Both athletes and coaches are available.
{% endif %}

{% if not athlete_list %}
	There are no athletes.
{% endif %}

{% if athlete_list or coach_list %}
	There are some athletes or some coaches.
{% endif %}

{% if not athlete_list or coach_list %}
	There are no athletes or there are some coaches. (OK, so
	writing English translations of Boolean logic sounds
	stupid; it's not our fault.)
{% endif %}

{% if athlete_list and not coach_list %}
	There are some athletes and absolutely no coaches.
{% endif %}

{% if %} tags don’t allow and and or clauses within the same tag, because the order of logic would be
ambiguous. For example, this is invalid:

{% if athlete_list and coach_list or cheerleader_list %}

The use of parentheses for controlling order of operations is not supported. If you find yourself needing
parentheses, consider performing logic in the view code in order to simplify the templates. Even so, if you
need to combine and and or to do advanced logic, just use nested {% if %} tags, for example:

{% if athlete_list %}
	{% if coach_list or cheerleader_list %}
	We have athletes, and either coaches or cheerleaders!
	{% endif %}
{% endif %}

Multiple uses of the same logical operator are fine, but you can’t combine different operators. For example,
this is valid:

{% if athlete_list or coach_list or parent_list or teacher_list %}

There is no {% elif %} tag. Use nested {% if %} tags to accomplish the same thing:
{% if athlete_list %}
	<p>Here are the athletes: {{ athlete_list }}.</p>
{% else %}
	<p>No athletes are available.</p>
	{% if coach_list %}
		<p>Here are the coaches: {{ coach_list }}.</p>
	{% endif %}
{% endif %}
