Just as in HTML or in a programming language such as Python, the Django template language allows for
comments. To designate a comment, use {# #}:

{# This is a comment #}

The comment will not be output when the template is rendered.

A comment cannot span multiple lines. This limitation improves template parsing performance. In the
following template, the rendered output will look exactly the same as the template (i.e., the comment tag will
not be parsed as a comment):

This is a {# this is not
a comment #}
