As explained earlier in this chapter, template filters are simple ways of altering the value of variables before
they’re displayed. Filters look like this:

{{ name|lower }}

This displays the value of the {{ name }} variable after being filtered through the lower filter, which
converts text to lowercase. Use a pipe (|) to apply a filter.

Filters can be chained—that is, the output of one filter is applied to the next. Here’s a common idiom for
escaping text contents, and then converting line breaks to <p> tags:

{{ my_text|escape|linebreaks }}

Some filters take arguments. A filter argument looks like this:

{{ bio|truncatewords:"30" }}

This displays the first 30 words of the bio variable. Filter arguments are always in double quotes.
The following are a few of the most important filters; Appendix F covers the rest.

	* addslashes: Adds a backslash before any backslash, single quote, or double quote. This is useful if
	the produced text is included in a JavaScript string.·
	* date: Formats a date or datetime object according to a format string given in the parameter, for
    example:
	
	{{ pub_date|date:"F j, Y" }}
